## about
Hereafter is a dark theme inspired by Xiao and Vermillion Hereafter from Genshin Impact. It's mostly composed of purple and teal, highlighting the palette of Xiao and the artifact set's tones.

The palette is also inspired by <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin" target="_blank">Catppuccin Mocha</a> as it is my most used theme by far.
